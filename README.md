EFI for HP Prodesk 400G6 DM
desktop config:

CPU: 10th 10500T
RAM: 8G
SSD: 256G
wired ethernet: intel 1219
Wireless ethernet: RTL8821

all of them are default config.

tested under bigSur11.6 and montonry12.3.1, not perfect but it could work and let you do comming configruation in the MacOS.
Hoping it could save your valueable time on this boring work.
